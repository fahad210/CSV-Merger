# Merge Multiple CSV Files in Python
Manually copy-pasting data from one csv to another is a tedious and time-consuming work. If you donâ€™t have too many files then manual 
copy-pasting is fine but imagine if you have 100+ files to merge, then manual copy-pasting is not a good  decision because doing same thing
again and again is tedious and chances of errors increases.
If all the files have the same structure (same headers), use this Python script to do the work.
